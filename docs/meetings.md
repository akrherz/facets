  - SWAT has some online tooling/data available for LOCA downscaled already,
    but this data is only for HUC10 and HUC8, they did not want to go down to

  - [x] various improvements for what was previously generated for SWAT files
    including prefix files with P and T, two seperate folders and generate the
    index file
  - Sirini is going to give a HAWQS talk on 23 April at 11 AM
