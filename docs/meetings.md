  Glisan, Gutowski, Arritt, Karuthe, Spender
  - Perhaps some of Alex and/or Jacob work can be merged into a senior thesis
  - Jacob is working on extreme winter precipitation stuff
  - Justin and Seth are working on metrics
  - [ ] I should be thresholding precip to 0.01 inches to make zeros
  - hadgem_base run got going again on cori
  - could an analysis of frontogenesis be made?
  - and so to clarify what runs Dr Arritt has in mind
