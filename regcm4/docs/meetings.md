-------------------------------------
 - Goal is to use SWAT as an evaluation metric, much in the same way as others
 - SWAT wants HUC12 level data, so we should just give it that
 - There is another model called HAWQS that appears to do finer scale
 - modelers may not be ready for Missouri basin data, but soon
 - Discussion on explicitly providing variables
 - [ ] daryl should do the areal zonal stats for 'regridding'
 - talk about investigating the wet/dry day biases associated with the decreasing
   grid scale
 - period of interest is 1990 to 2010 initially
 - gonna do daily windspeed, rh, and solar rad (SWdown)
 - There are SWAT documents detailing the formats of each
 - likely will have two year spinup, using 'real' data for 1988 and 1989
